## A new look

The problem: the previous iteration of the RNS website was very slow, hard to navigate, many elements were misaligned, and even the body text font was broken. RNS needed a modern, fast, and easy to use site.

The solution: I rebuilt and redesigned the entire ReligionNews.com frontend. ReligionNews.com gets over 2 million page views a month, so we needed a fast, highly SEO optimized site. The new frontend’s page speed is 2x faster than the previous site and SEO has been improved 15% — helping to double our Alexa ranking. The new site also has many UX improvements.
